This is some ongoing work with from Dr. Hedges and myself at BYU, as well as John Murray and his lab at Yale. This is the main back bone, and we've been using the brian simulator (see more at http://briansimulator.org). This model has been serving primarily as validation to neural network activity for patients with schizophrenia taking different antipsychotics.
